There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 1984
•	What operating system does it run? CP/M 2.2

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
	Sources vary on original cost. InfoWorld (March, 1984) lists the price at $1595 (with inflation, $3,653); Russ Walters in The Secret Guide to Computers lists the price at $1795 (with inflation, $4,110). It seems to be pretty rare in the secondhand market, especially considering that there is only one (printer included) on sale on eBay for $299. You can find several other Kaypro models, especially the Kaypro 2 and the Kaypro 2X. The InfoWorld article suggests that the Kaypro 4 was renamed the Kaypro 2X, so it may be easier to find as the 2X (and comes along with a cooler name than plain "4"). I was unable to find a Kaypro on CL, looking first to San Diego, Kaypro's headquarters of yesteryear.

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
	I had many difficulties trying to operate the Kaypro in terms of loading software and "moving" through the system. It is clear that the mouse was invented to make the computer more accessible to the general public, unlike the Kaypro. Most of what I can find about the Kaypro suggests that its "rugged" exterior lent itself to durability and portability. With the small screen embedded into the main console, it makes portability much easier as compared to a separate monitor and system unit. It also seems to be very well-protected, unlike the plastic-component models. Additionally, the unit includes a modem (which can apparently be used today to reconnect with the modern Internet) that could be used to upgrade the system, as well as a popular software bundle. Also, it seems to  have come along with a lower price-tag than others during that timeframe, which makes the system at least more financially accessible and a likely historical strength. Another weakness could be that they missed a great chance to make some type of Orwellian reference considering its release date.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

===================================================================================================================
APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 1983
•	What operating system does it run? OS 3.3 or ProDOS; Could run CP/M and MS-DOS with optional card modifications.

•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
	ComputerWorld (1985) suggests a price (including a dot matrix printer) of $2,100 (with inflation, $5,017) at an Apple dealer store. On Ebay, there are several listings, including full working systems with software and various individual parts. By some miracle, one listing claims to have a brand new, still-in-the box IIe at $8,999.95, while the price of a used models are listed at a broad range from $800 to $4,000. CL has some posting for local listings, one is posted in "good condition" for $250.

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
	I feel that the Apple IIe does what Apple continues to do today: make users feel the “human” element of its technologies. When touring the tutorial, it was clear that Macintosh had a clear focus on usability and demystifying, in often clever and sassy ways, the personal computer for its users. Interestingly, the tutorial reminded me of the affective experience of “talking” to Siri, yet in a nostalgic way that was like speaking to the dead, yet still while finding Ernst’s “sweetness of the human voice.” Sources claim that the IIe was well-received, despite its high cost, and that it had a run of eleven years with very few changes. Tom Shae, of InfoWorld (1983), claimed that the reason for its compatibility, and hence popularity with users, was due to the fact that Apple was in touch with software developers before the release of the model so that software would continue to be compatible with the IIe. It is also clear that while it focused on business productivity, the model was intended for home use (hence its “tone” of usability and gentle summoning into the computer world) which expanded its user base, and I assume, shaped the way computers have become our everyday companions. Apple-History.com suggests that the model could produce better graphics (hence, gaming) and was easy to upgrade (and customize) because of its "open architecture." Wikipedia notes its ability to use both upper- and lowercase letters. From my standpoint, the “plug and play” of the floppy disks is very clear and easy to operate.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 1987
•	What operating system does it run? MacOS (3.3-3.4, 4.0–6.0.2, 6.0.3–6.0.8, 7.0-7.5.5, according to Wikipedia)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
	In terms of original cost, Wikipedia suggests $2900 with a dual floppy and $3900 with 20 MB hard drive. Accounting for inflation, those prices are $6,074 and $8,168 respectively. The SE seems to be relatively easy to find on the secondhand market. Ebay has several listings for various SE editions in various conditions, while CL has a handful of listings. One that "turns on" is listed for $15, while a listing in excellent condition is $1,300.

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
	After working with the Kaypro and the Apple IIe, the Macintosh SE was a bit more “familiar.”  Gabriel Torres on HardwareSecrets.com suggests that this familiarity is more than likely due to the fact that it has an internal hard drive, which enables the feel of the computer’s “living” on the easily-navigable desktop. He also, of course, mentions the mouse, which makes for easy, organic navigation. Additionally, the SE was able to use multiple floppy disks simultaneously. In my experience of it, its small size varied drastically from my memory of “old” computers; it felt less intrusive and more like a domestic technology, like a Kindle. Despite my appreciation for its small size, the small monitor may affect the way users interact with the computer. This model has more capacity, ability for expansion (which is why the “SE” stands for “System Expansion,” according to WikiPedia), and a cooling fan that increases its lifespan.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
	I was unable to find much more than Marble Springs. Despite that, it did have basic Apple Menu Items, such as a calculator, note pad (with notes from past users!), and an alarm clock. I tried to explore the harddrive, but found difficulty opening some of the files and was unclear what they were.
===================================================================================================================
VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 1982
•	What operating system does it run? The Vectrex Museum website suggests that the OS ran on a 8-inch floppy disk (I am unclear how this is different that use/function of other OSs). Also, it uses ROM cartridges and has a Motorola MC68A09 CPU. 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
	According to Popular Science (1983), the original cost had a broad range of $100-$300 (accounting for inflation, $247-$740). Ebay has several listings for the console, controllers, and games. Listings vary based on condition, and other included items such as games, original box, controllers, etc. There are only about 12 listings selling the actual system, and the price varies from $200 to $600 in working condition, and one in need of repair for $57. CL has a handful of listings similar to the price range on Ebay.

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
	Brett Weiss in Classic Home Video Games calls the Vertex the “king of stand-alone games.” It was unique because of its vector display with a 3D imager, sound effects/music ability, and its compatibility with arcade games, which were also based on vector graphics that allowed those games to migrate into people’s homes (according to Wikipedia). Despite this, many of the popular vector display games, like Asteroids and Battlezone, were only available for other consoles (Weiss), which contributed to its very short lifespan in the home console market. Additionally, the console is self-contained and does not require a TV or other parts for play, which makes it relatively portable (along with its size). Also, the use of screen overlays allows for each game to be customized very easily, not to mention the great build-in audio capabilities. Not only were many cartridge games creates for the system, it also came with MineStorm. The joystick and attached buttons seemed very similar to the NES controller in terms of usability. I felt very at home with the controls because of that similarity. (One clear weakness is that the Star Trek game seems to heavily disobey the Prime Directive).
  
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm (BEST GAME EVER). Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
	They may have opted for vector graphics because, as mentioned before, the connection to many arcade games of the time. Vector graphics, unlike raster graphics, can be scaled without losing quality (according to UCreative.com) and worked well with the plastic overlays. Also, they create a really cool gameplay and aesthetic experience.

===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 1985
•	What operating system does it run? AmigaOS 1.0
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
	Wikipedia suggests that the base system sold for $1,295 ($2,864 with inflation) when it was released in 1985. InfoWorld (1987) lists the Amiga for $849 ($1,778 with inflation), and an upgraded Amiga System Package for $1199 ($2,511 with inflation). Ebay has several models, mostly individual parts than full systems, listed. In terms of the 1000, there are three system listings: $550, $800, and $5,900. It appears that the system comes up for sale every so often on CL, but most of the postings have been taken down. Google lists several Amiga auction websites and seems to have quite the cult following.


•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
	When I sat down at the Amiga, it was clear that this computer was different: somehow clunky due to the constant floppy-swapping,  yet colorful and full of potential.  The Future Was Here confirmed my original assessments, suggesting that while the Amiga was the “world’s first true multimedia computer,” the DOS component of the operating system was “clunky and ill-matched” and often crashed when attempting multitasking (quoting the book summary on Amazon). The multiple copies of Amiga magazine also highlight and showcase the multimedia capabilities of the system. Max Headroom, one of my earliest and still dearly-beloved introductions to the science fiction of computing possibilities, was made on the Amiga. After working with the Amiga and the early Macs, the resemblance of today’s computers to their ancestors becomes clear (like looking at old family photo albums). The Amiga’s graphics and sound effects improved the potential of gaming and other multimedia endeavors, unlike the gentle black/white or green phosphor glow of the other computers in MITH’s line-up.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here. 
	The Amiga Appetizer disk offered word processing (with a really unique interface that I found quite difficult to navigate), a tile game, a music composer (which was quite advanced, even similar to programs I used to compose music in the mid-2000s), and a paint program. The floppy disk collection had several programs, including a kind of "financial cookbook" program that offered many "recipes" like how to pay off debt, buy a house, etc. (needs to be updated for student loans). I had difficulty loading the Deluxe Paint program, but it is clearly impressive and would be a great program to revisit to create new artwork and projects, considering its nostalgic aesthetic.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 1989
•	What operating system does it run? System 6.0.4-System 7.1.1(Pro), System 7.5-Mac OS 7.6.1 (according to Wikipedia)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
	This system with incredibly expensive. Wikipedia and Computerworld (1989) list the original selling price as $6,269 ($12,030 with inflation), $9,152 ($17,562 with inflation) for the upgraded RAM. Ebay has relatively few listings, with many of those selling parts, rather than he whole system. There are only three complete sets listed at $150, $380, and $550. CL has a few listings in similar price ranges.

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
	Lowendmac.com suggests that this system offered more power than the MacII in the same compact size case. On the website, Dan Knight suggests that this system was one of the best Mac computers ever made because it was a “powerhouse,” with a larger display, expandability, and speed. It also had a commendable built-in graphics card and stereo audio. Most of the sources I have reviewed rarely mention weaknesses of this system, referring mostly to its speed and reliability; however, a review of the system in Computerworld (1990) suggests that it was much more expensive than other computers of the time because Apple cornered the market on add-ons and peripherals. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)? 
	Although MSW feels more familiar, because of my many years of using it, WP has many nice features. I like that WP has a word-based menu, which allows for easy navigation without cluttering the screen. MSW has several  image-based buttons whose semiotic meaning has clearly been lost to me over the years. While WP does also use image-based icons/buttons, if you hover the cursor over the icon, a text-based caption will appear at the bottom of the screen. Also, I like the framing of WP, in which the document does appear in a separate window like MSW, but the toolbar at the top and bottom frame the document. The bottom toolbar is helpful because it lists the page number and other helpful information (which have been since incorporated into MSW’s design). Despite this, the MSW interface seems somehow more updated, while WP looks and feels a bit more “simple,” like TextEdit today. Additionally, MacPaint is a completely different experience in B/W and it is interesting how designers used gradients and different paint brushes to expand what could be created without color.
	There is a magnitude of information (perhaps too much?) about this computer's past user still on the harddrive. Mr. Rough was the head of Nonprint Media Services, which was (is?) located in Hornbake Library, and is more than likely where this computer lived during its glory days. He appears to have used the machine for several years in the 90s. Also, if his actual first name is Gaylord, the Amiga belonged to him, as well. He used the computer to create signs/brochures for his office, write memos and other letters, and keep track of inventory.
